   "description": "Juicebox Governance Token or veBanny is a voting escrow token that represents an individual's voting weight based on the amount of tokens locked over a set duration. Benefits bestowed upon each holder, in addition to ongoing governance, is the exclusive ability to generate custom Bannys at https://bannyverse.xyz - every genesis Banny character generated during this period has unique characteristics exploitable within the BannyVerse.\nAbout Juicebox, WAGMI Studios and our Lord and Savior, OG Banny.\nJuicebox, https://juicebox.money, is a programmable treasury for community-owned Ethereum projects.\nWAGMI Studios, https://wagmistudios.xyz, is a collective of quirky creatives making sure \"we're all gonna make it\" and the home of Lord Banny, our Savior.\nThe BannyVerse, https://bannyverse.xyz, home to the OG Banny who is an anthropomorphic banana, who provides visual aesthetics to all things Juicebox including its website and documentation.  Banny enjoys hot knifing hash, educating communities on the Juicebox protocol, and parodying pop-culture characters and historical heavyweights.  OG Banny is also the protagonist in the epic fruit-salad saga, the BannyVerse, an IRL mystery pay-to-have, play-to-earn, have-to-enjoy status-symbol-utility-art wallet-accessory masquerading as unapproachable, Web3, hard-core zinc filled cartoon nutrient toying with flex-seeking crypto-whales by dispensing FOMO. LOL.\n Whether you want some fresh hummus, or a nice gyro with a side of sweet potato fries, or even just one of your enemies dismembered by a psycho with a meat cleaver who can also keep rhythm on the beat, Bronson is your banana. Cuddly and unassuming at first glance, he’ll turn up the charm if you’re been nice, and the violence if you’ve been naughty. He runs a tight ship on any kitchen, and he likes to bring the pain when he needs to. Some say the meals he makes can put any man in good spirits. He’s always wanted to cook for Farceur, who he heard was down in the dumps, but so far he’s never had a chance. Will that change in the future? We makin’ enemies or we makin’ kafta over here?",
