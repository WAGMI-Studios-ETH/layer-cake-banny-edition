   "description": "Juicebox Governance Token or veBanny is a voting escrow token that represents an individual's voting weight based on the amount of tokens locked over a set duration. Benefits bestowed upon each holder, in addition to ongoing governance, is the exclusive ability to generate custom Bannys at https://bannyverse.xyz - every genesis Banny character generated during this period has unique characteristics exploitable within the BannyVerse.\nAbout Juicebox, WAGMI Studios and our Lord and Savior, OG Banny.\nJuicebox, https://juicebox.money, is a programmable treasury for community-owned Ethereum projects.\nWAGMI Studios, https://wagmistudios.xyz, is a collective of quirky creatives making sure \"we're all gonna make it\" and the home of Lord Banny, our Savior.\nThe BannyVerse, https://bannyverse.xyz, home to the OG Banny who is an anthropomorphic banana, who provides visual aesthetics to all things Juicebox including its website and documentation.  Banny enjoys hot knifing hash, educating communities on the Juicebox protocol, and parodying pop-culture characters and historical heavyweights.  OG Banny is also the protagonist in the epic fruit-salad saga, the BannyVerse, an IRL mystery pay-to-have, play-to-earn, have-to-enjoy status-symbol-utility-art wallet-accessory masquerading as unapproachable, Web3, hard-core zinc filled cartoon nutrient toying with flex-seeking crypto-whales by dispensing FOMO. LOL.\n\nThe Banny that started it all. The one. The only. The magnificent, majestic and magnanimous. The OG Banny. All Bannies take some part from illustrious existence. Many Bannies tell tales of a vague, distant memory— some ascribe it to pure chance, others to the supernatural. Then yet other will tell you that OG Banny is bound to come into the world, in full, fleshy banana form. Others say he has come back many times, sometimes as an apple, other times as an orange. And yet others say he is yet to come, and when he comes, existence as we know it will change. And then there’s those who say that he’s far more than any of that: he’s a historical whisper, lost for generations and whose echo reverberates around the lore he inspired. An OG, if ever there was one.\nIn the beginning, there was OG Banny.",
