   "description": "Juicebox Governance Token or veBanny is a voting escrow token that represents an individual's voting weight based on the amount of tokens locked over a set duration. Benefits bestowed upon each holder, in addition to ongoing governance, is the exclusive ability to generate custom Bannys at https://bannyverse.xyz - every genesis Banny character generated during this period has unique characteristics exploitable within the BannyVerse.\n\nAbout Juicebox, WAGMI Studios and our Lord and Savior, OG Banny.\n\nJuicebox, https://juicebox.money, is a programmable treasury for community-owned Ethereum projects.\n\nWAGMI Studios, https://wagmistudios.xyz, is a collective of quirky creatives making sure \"we're all gonna make it\" and the home of Lord Banny, our Savior.\n\nThe BannyVerse, https://bannyverse.xyz, home to the OG Banny who is an anthropomorphic banana, who provides visual aesthetics to all things Juicebox including its website and documentation.  Banny enjoys hot knifing hash, educating communities on the Juicebox protocol, and parodying pop-culture characters and historical heavyweights.  OG Banny is also the protagonist in the epic fruit-salad saga, the BannyVerse, an IRL mystery pay-to-have, play-to-earn, have-to-enjoy status-symbol-utility-art wallet-accessory masquerading as unapproachable, Web3, hard-core zinc filled cartoon nutrient toying with flex-seeking crypto-whales by dispensing FOMO. LOL.\n\nSmalls isn’t a banana that strikes you as remarkable at first glance, but that’s only because it takes him a while to come into his own. He’s a moderately tempered, mellow-headed banana that experienced many rites of passage to get where he is. He may not be the first banana you think of when you need a pinch hitter at the bottom of the ninth, but you can definitely count on him being there and having your back. He’s a good banana, at a time when that old childhood innocent fun-loving life is the exception, not the rule. Wholesome, whether in a bowl of cereal or on top of a 1950’s style banana split, Smalls brings you good times and comfort.\nI’m a mirror for your adolescence.",
