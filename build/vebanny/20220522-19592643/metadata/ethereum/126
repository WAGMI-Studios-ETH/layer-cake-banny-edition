   "description": "Juicebox Governance Token or veBanny is a voting escrow token that represents an individual's voting weight based on the amount of tokens locked over a set duration. Benefits bestowed upon each holder, in addition to ongoing governance, is the exclusive ability to generate custom Bannys at https://bannyverse.xyz - every genesis Banny character generated during this period has unique characteristics exploitable within the BannyVerse.\n\nAbout Juicebox, WAGMI Studios and our Lord and Savior, OG Banny.\n\nJuicebox, https://juicebox.money, is a programmable treasury for community-owned Ethereum projects.\n\nWAGMI Studios, https://wagmistudios.xyz, is a collective of quirky creatives making sure \"we're all gonna make it\" and the home of Lord Banny, our Savior.\n\nThe BannyVerse, https://bannyverse.xyz, home to the OG Banny who is an anthropomorphic banana, who provides visual aesthetics to all things Juicebox including its website and documentation.  Banny enjoys hot knifing hash, educating communities on the Juicebox protocol, and parodying pop-culture characters and historical heavyweights.  OG Banny is also the protagonist in the epic fruit-salad saga, the BannyVerse, an IRL mystery pay-to-have, play-to-earn, have-to-enjoy status-symbol-utility-art wallet-accessory masquerading as unapproachable, Web3, hard-core zinc filled cartoon nutrient toying with flex-seeking crypto-whales by dispensing FOMO. LOL.\n\nThis banny is principled and deft with a gun and sword. While not the most chirpy musketeer banny out there, he’s among the most lethal. Ever-troubled and a banana that turns to the drink more than most, he will stick up for what’s right, even if it means killing a part of himself in the process. He still grieves from the death of his wife, Ms. Musketeer, who he had to kill when he discovered that she was on the run. Justice trumps personal feelings, but he still loves her. He knows the deep truth to his existence: the banana that lives be the gun dies by it also.\nLet justice be served, no matter the cost.",
