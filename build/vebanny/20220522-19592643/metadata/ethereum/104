   "description": "Juicebox Governance Token or veBanny is a voting escrow token that represents an individual's voting weight based on the amount of tokens locked over a set duration. Benefits bestowed upon each holder, in addition to ongoing governance, is the exclusive ability to generate custom Bannys at https://bannyverse.xyz - every genesis Banny character generated during this period has unique characteristics exploitable within the BannyVerse.\n\nAbout Juicebox, WAGMI Studios and our Lord and Savior, OG Banny.\n\nJuicebox, https://juicebox.money, is a programmable treasury for community-owned Ethereum projects.\n\nWAGMI Studios, https://wagmistudios.xyz, is a collective of quirky creatives making sure \"we're all gonna make it\" and the home of Lord Banny, our Savior.\n\nThe BannyVerse, https://bannyverse.xyz, home to the OG Banny who is an anthropomorphic banana, who provides visual aesthetics to all things Juicebox including its website and documentation.  Banny enjoys hot knifing hash, educating communities on the Juicebox protocol, and parodying pop-culture characters and historical heavyweights.  OG Banny is also the protagonist in the epic fruit-salad saga, the BannyVerse, an IRL mystery pay-to-have, play-to-earn, have-to-enjoy status-symbol-utility-art wallet-accessory masquerading as unapproachable, Web3, hard-core zinc filled cartoon nutrient toying with flex-seeking crypto-whales by dispensing FOMO. LOL.\n\nIf class and style is what you want, look no further than this very gentlemanly banana. Bannible Lector is someone you can count on for a good classical music recommendation or tips on how to whip up a nice Chateaubriand. His culinary exploits are quite daring and he’s never been afraid to take a risk, whether in or out of the kitchen. With a laser-focused mind that can read you like an open book, he finds all the restraints he’s packaged up in just a tad off-putting. Come help him take off his straitjacket and muzzle— he’ll reward you with a nice home-cooked dish!\nI eat bananas with a side of fava beans and chianti.",
